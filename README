# 🚀 **YouTube Viral Video Forecasting**

### Dataset Used

We utilized data from the [YouTube Trending Video Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rsrishav/youtube-trending-video-dataset?resource=download&select=US_youtube_trending_data.csv) on Kaggle.

## 🚀 **Project Overview**

This project develops a machine learning model to predict whether a YouTube video will go viral based on its metadata, such as titles, tags, descriptions, and user engagement statistics.

---


Removed non-finite and NaN values.
Applied one-hot encoding for categorical features.
Handled outliers using transformations and capping.
Feature Engineering:

Calculated metrics like like-to-dislike ratio, comment engagement rate, and views-per-hour.
Created a user interaction restriction flag based on engagement indicators.
Natural Language Processing (NLP):

Preprocessed text data from titles, tags, and descriptions using tokenization, lemmatization, and TF-IDF vectorization.
Preserved viral signals, such as hashtags and capitalized terms.
Modeling:

Trained a Random Forest Classifier to predict virality.
Utilized correlation heatmaps to assess feature importance.
Tested alternative models like logistic regression, k-means clustering, and hierarchical clustering for better insights.
Evaluation:

Used metrics like R-squared and accuracy to evaluate the model's performance.
📊 Results and Key Findings
Emotional words, call-to-action phrases, and optimal tag diversity strongly correlate with video virality.
Descriptions featuring trending topics and engaging language increase the likelihood of reaching a wider audience.
Rapid viewer engagement (e.g., high views-per-hour) is a strong predictor of virality.
📈 Visualizations
Correlation heatmaps highlighted relationships between numerical features.
TF-IDF bar plots displayed top words contributing to video success.
Box plots illustrated the distribution of features like view_count and comment_count.
🔮 Potential Next Steps
Incorporate non-viral video data to address class imbalance.
Fine-tune models to reduce overfitting and improve generalizability.
Analyze sentiment in video comments to provide deeper insights.
Develop a machine learning pipeline for continuous updates as new data becomes available.
